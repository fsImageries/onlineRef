# OnlineRef
## About
OnlineRef is an online image canvas tool for easy collection of reference material.
It's was originally written in vanilla javascript but is now running on [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).
It is using [KonvaJS](https://github.com/konvajs/konva) for canvas manipulation and webpack for dev and building.

You can visit it [here.](https://fsimageries.github.io/onlineRef/)

## Usage
At the moment only browser accepted formats are supported.

You can simply drag&drop images/video into the app or import through the dedicated function. You can also enter a link directly to an online resource.
It's designed to work with online resources so dropping from google should work on all images. 

It's very unstable at the moment, it's recommended to only use it with local media for now.

A help menu is also not implemented at the moment but will be coming in the future. For now when you expand the Tool Menu it will show you shortcuts and what it's function is on the tooltip.
